Home Control Using OCPP

This project utilizes the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) to create an integrated system for managing various home energy devices. While OCPP is primarily used for managing EV chargers, its versatility allows it to be applied to home energy devices and IoT devices, offering a unified control solution.

Key Features:
Easy Integration: OCPP enables not just the management of EV chargers but also devices such as batteries, solar panels, water heaters, and other home energy systems.

Bidirectional Communication: OCPP supports bidirectional communication, allowing real-time device status monitoring, control, and event reporting.

Scalability: This makes it easy to add future home energy devices or integrate with other protocols as the system expands.

Security: OCPP ensures secure communication between devices, keeping sensitive home energy data safe.

Use Cases:
Battery Management: Manage the charging and discharging states of home batteries (energy storage systems) and optimize power supply timing.

Solar Power System: Monitor real-time solar power generation and energy consumption, supporting optimal energy utilization.

Centralized Home Device Management: Control various home devices like eco-friendly water heaters and heat pumps, contributing to energy efficiency.

This project aims to smartly manage home energy, creating a more efficient and sustainable future.
